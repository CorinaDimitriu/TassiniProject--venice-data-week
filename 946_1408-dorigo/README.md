# 946 - 1408 Dorigo

## Overview

This repository contains extracted data from the book 'Venezia Romanica' (W. Dorigo, 2003) [1], which is physically and digitally available at the DHLab. Dorigo compiled many observations with corresponding dates about ownerships and places for medieval Venice (`tables` folder). He assigned each observation to a particular zone in different quarters of Venice (`geometries` folder). Information about the extraction process of tables and maps can be found in [2]. Addionally, Dorigo provided indices for person and place names (`indices` folder). These entries as well as additional features have been matched with the data from the tables (see `entities` folder) via fuzzy String matching.
